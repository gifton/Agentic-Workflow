# Agentic Workflow - Example: URL Shortener

## Task: Build a URL shortener service

Create a simple URL shortener that takes long URLs and returns short codes. Should handle basic CRUD operations and redirect properly.

---

## Plan 
*Time: 5 minutes*

**Break down the task:**
- [x] Step 1: Set up basic web server
- [x] Step 2: Create URL storage (in-memory for now)
- [x] Step 3: Implement shortening algorithm  
- [x] Step 4: Add redirect endpoint
- [x] Step 5: Create simple web interface

**Identify risks:**
- [x] Main technical risk: Collision handling for short codes
- [x] Main complexity: Efficient lookup for redirects
- [x] Key dependency: None - using standard library

**Initial confidence:** 85/100

*Why this confidence level?* Standard web service pattern, no external dependencies, clear requirements

## Review
*Time: 10 minutes*

**Functionality Check:**
- [x] All requirements met?
- [x] Core functionality works?
- [x] Edge cases handled?

## Decision

âœ… **Ready to ship!** (82/100)

This is a solid MVP. The identified issues are enhancements, not blockers. Can be deployed and improved iteratively.

**Next action:** Ship as v1.0, plan persistence for v1.1
