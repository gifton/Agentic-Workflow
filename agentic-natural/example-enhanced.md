# Agentic Workflow - Example: ML Pipeline (with enhancements)

*Using: "agentic natural with checkpoints and metrics tracking"*

## Task: Build ML pipeline for customer churn prediction

Create an end-to-end pipeline that ingests customer data, trains a model, and serves predictions via API.

---

## Plan 
*Time: 15 minutes*

**Break down the task:**
- [x] Step 1: Data ingestion and validation
- [x] Step 2: Feature engineering pipeline
- [x] Step 3: Model training with hyperparameter tuning
- [x] Step 4: Model evaluation and selection
- [x] Step 5: API deployment with monitoring

**Identify risks:**
- [x] Main technical risk: Data quality and drift
- [x] Main complexity: Feature engineering choices
- [x] Key dependency: Scikit-learn, FastAPI

**Initial confidence:** 70/100

*Why this confidence level?* ML projects have inherent uncertainty, depends heavily on data quality
