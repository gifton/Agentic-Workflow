## üé® Creating Your Own

Start with the basic pattern:
1. What are you building? (`for ...`)
2. What features do you need? (`with ...`)
3. Any specific approach? (`using ...`)
4. Time constraints? (`in ...`)
5. What's most important? (`optimized for ...`)
6. Who's working on it? (`by ...`)

Then combine naturally:
```
agentic natural for [your project] with [your features] 
using [your approach] in [your timeframe] 
optimized for [your goal] by [your team]
```

Remember: Start simple, add modifiers as needed!
