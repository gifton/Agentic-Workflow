## What is Agentic Natural?

Agentic Natural is the next evolution of the Agentic Workflow system. Instead of choosing between multiple implementations, you get **one smart workflow** that scales naturally with your needs through natural language.

## Core Philosophy

- **Start simple** - Basic workflow takes 30 seconds to understand
- **Scale naturally** - Add features through natural language
- **Zero configuration** - No JSON, no setup, just copy and use
- **Progressive enhancement** - Complexity only when you need it

## How It Adapts

The workflow intelligently modifies itself based on your command:

### Structure Adaptations
- **Basic**: Plan ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Ship
- **With checkpoints**: Adds save points after major steps
- **For team**: Adds handoff and communication sections
- **Using TDD**: Restructures to test-first cycle
- **In 2 hours**: Compresses to essential steps only
- **With zen**: Integrates zen-mcp tools at critical points

### Content Adaptations  
- **For web API**: Adds routes, error handling, API docs sections
- **For ML model**: Adds data prep, training, evaluation sections
- **With metrics**: Adds measurement points throughout
- **Optimized for quality**: Expands review criteria
- **In learning mode**: Adds explanations and resources

### Zen-MCP Intelligence
When you add "with zen", the workflow automatically uses:
- **zen planner** - For complex task breakdown
- **zen analyze** - For architecture and code analysis
- **zen debug** - For troubleshooting and root cause analysis
- **zen codereview** - For comprehensive code quality checks
- **zen testgen** - For test suite generation
- **zen consensus** - For validation and decision making
- **zen thinkdeep** - For complex problem solving

## How It Works

### 1. Copy the Template
```bash
cp agentic-natural/workflow.md your-project/
```

### 2. Set Up Recognition (Important for Large Projects!)
Add to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:
```markdown
## Agentic Workflow
This project uses Agentic Natural. Check workflow.md for structured tasks.
Commands: "agentic natural [for ...] [with ...]"
```

See the full **[Setup Guide](../SETUP.md)** for more options.

### 3. Fill It Out
Replace the placeholders with your actual task details.

### 4. Use It
Tell your AI assistant: "Follow the agentic natural in workflow.md"

That's it! No configuration files, no complex setup.

## The Universal Workflow

Every project follows the same simple pattern:

1. **Plan** - Break down the task and assess confidence
2. **Build** - Implement each step with self-testing
3. **Review** - Check functionality and quality
4. **Decide** - Ship or iterate based on confidence

```

The AI will guide you:
```
I'll help you set up the right workflow. Let me ask a few quick questions:

? What are you building?
  > web API
  
? How much time do you have?
  > A few days
  
? Are you working alone or with a team?
  > Small team (3 people)
  
? What's most important?
  > Getting it right, not just fast

Based on your answers, I recommend:
\"agentic natural for web API with automated testing by small team optimized for quality\"
```

## Smart Defaults

The system intelligently adapts based on context:

- **\"for hackathon\"** ‚Üí Implies speed > perfection, minimal docs, quick iterations
- **\"for production\"** ‚Üí Implies full testing, monitoring, proper error handling
- **\"in 2 hours\"** ‚Üí Automatically simplifies to core features only
- **\"using TDD\"** ‚Üí Restructures entire flow around test-first development
- **\"by distributed team\"** ‚Üí Adds async communication points, clear handoffs

## Best Practices

1. **Start minimal** - Don't add modifiers until needed
2. **Use presets** - \"express\", \"standard\", \"professional\" cover 80% of cases
3. **Trust inference** - The system is smart about implications
4. **Be specific about constraints** - Time and team size matter most
5. **Combine naturally** - Commands read like English sentences
6. **Iterate on commands** - Start simple, add modifiers as needed

## FAQ

**Q: What if I need a feature not listed?**
A: Just describe what you need in natural language. The AI will adapt the workflow. For example: \"agentic natural with database migrations\" will add migration steps.

**Q: Can I combine multiple project types?**
A: Yes! Try: \"agentic natural for web API and CLI tool\" to get a workflow that handles both.

**Q: What's the difference between the presets?**
A: 
- **express**: 1-2 hours, minimal process, ship fast
- **standard**: Balanced quality/speed, good for most projects  
- **professional**: Full testing and documentation, production-ready
- **enterprise**: Adds compliance, audit trails, extensive docs
- **research**: Heavy on exploration, experimentation, learning

**Q: Do I need to specify everything?**
A: No! Start simple and the system will ask for clarification if needed. \"agentic natural\" alone works fine.

**Q: Can I use multiple \"with\" statements?**
A: Yes! Chain them: \"with checkpoints and metrics and visual progress\"

**Q: How specific should time constraints be?**
A: Any format works: \"in 2 hours\", \"by Friday\", \"in sprint 3\", \"ASAP\"

**Q: What happens if I mix conflicting goals?**
A: The AI will flag conflicts and suggest alternatives. For example, \"optimized for quality in 30 minutes\" will prompt for priority clarification.

**Q: Can I save my favorite command combinations?**
A: Yes! Create an alias: \"agentic natural my-stack\" where my-stack = \"for web API with monitoring using TypeScript optimized for maintainability\"

**Q: Is the order of modifiers important?**
A: No, the system understands any order. These are equivalent:
- \"for API with tests using TDD\"
- \"using TDD for API with tests\"
- \"with tests for API using TDD\"
