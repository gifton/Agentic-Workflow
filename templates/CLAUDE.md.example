# Project Assistant Instructions

## Agentic Workflow Integration

This project uses the **Agentic Natural** workflow system for complex development tasks.

### Workflow Location
- Primary: `./workflow.md` 
- Fallback: `./.agentic/workflow.md`

### How to Use
1. When I say "agentic natural" or mention complex tasks, check for workflow.md
2. Follow the multi-agent structured approach (Orchestrator → Specialist → Evaluator)
3. Track confidence on a 0-100 scale throughout the work
4. Update the workflow file inline with progress

### Natural Language Commands
The workflow adapts based on natural language modifiers:

```
agentic natural
  [for {project-type}]     # What we're building
  [with {features}]        # Capabilities needed  
  [using {approach}]       # Methodology or tech
  [in {mode/time}]         # Time constraints
  [optimized for {goal}]   # Primary objective
  [by {team-structure}]    # Who's working
```

### Common Examples
- `agentic natural` - Interactive mode
- `agentic natural express` - Ship in <2 hours
- `agentic natural for web API with testing` - API with test suite
- `agentic natural for feature optimized for quality` - Quality-first approach

### Confidence Thresholds
- 80-100: Ready to ship ✅
- 60-79: Minor fixes needed ⚠️  
- 0-59: Major work required 🔄

### Important Notes
- Always read workflow.md before starting complex tasks
- Update confidence scores as work progresses
- The workflow adapts based on the command modifiers
- One workflow file handles all complexity levels
