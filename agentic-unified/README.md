# Agentic Unified - The One Workflow to Rule Them All

> One simple workflow that adapts to any project size or complexity.

## What is Agentic Unified?

Agentic Unified is the next evolution of the Agentic Workflow system. Instead of choosing between multiple implementations, you get **one smart workflow** that scales naturally with your needs.

## Core Philosophy

- **Start simple** - Basic workflow takes 30 seconds to understand
- **Scale naturally** - Add features through natural language
- **Zero configuration** - No JSON, no setup, just copy and use
- **Progressive enhancement** - Complexity only when you need it

## How It Works

### 1. Copy the Template
```bash
cp agentic-unified/workflow.md your-project/
```

### 2. Fill It Out
Replace the placeholders with your actual task details.

### 3. Use It
Tell your AI assistant: "Follow the agentic workflow in workflow.md"

That's it! No configuration files, no complex setup.

## The Universal Workflow

Every project follows the same simple pattern:

1. **Plan** - Break down the task and assess confidence
2. **Build** - Implement each step with self-testing
3. **Review** - Check functionality and quality
4. **Decide** - Ship or iterate based on confidence

## Progressive Enhancement

Need more features? Just ask naturally:

### Basic Usage
```
"Use the agentic workflow"
```

### With Checkpoints
```
"Use the agentic workflow with checkpoints"
```
Adds: Save points after major steps, rollback capability

### For Team Projects
```
"Use the agentic workflow for our team"
```
Adds: Handoff sections, communication points, review assignments

### With Detailed Review
```
"Use the agentic workflow with detailed review"
```
Adds: Security checks, performance analysis, code coverage

### Custom Combinations
```
"Use the agentic workflow with checkpoints and metrics tracking for our team"
```

## Confidence Scoring

Simple 0-100 scale with clear thresholds:
- **80-100**: Ready to ship ‚úÖ
- **60-79**: Minor fixes needed ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **0-59**: Major work required üîÑ

## Example Usage

### Simple Task
```markdown
## Task: Add dark mode to website

## Plan
- [ ] Add CSS variables for colors
- [ ] Create theme switcher component  
- [ ] Save preference to localStorage
- [ ] Test across browsers

Initial confidence: 85/100
*Clear requirements, standard implementation*
```

### Complex Task (with enhancements)
```markdown
## Task: Build distributed task queue

## Plan
- [ ] Design message format
- [ ] Implement queue service
- [ ] Add worker pool
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Load test system

[Checkpoint: Architecture approved]

Initial confidence: 65/100
*Complex distributed system, need careful testing*
```

## Why Unified?

1. **No Decision Paralysis** - One workflow for everything
2. **Instant Onboarding** - New team members understand in minutes
3. **Flexible Yet Simple** - Adapts without complexity
4. **Plain English** - No mythological names or jargon
5. **Future Proof** - Add new enhancements without new templates

## Migration from Other Variants

Currently using another variant? Unified can replace:
- **devdocs-zen** ‚Üí Use basic unified workflow
- **devdocs-standard** ‚Üí Use unified with team enhancement
- **devdocs-advanced** ‚Üí Use unified with all enhancements
- **devdocs-zen-py** ‚Üí Use unified with ML-specific prompts

## Best Practices

1. **Start minimal** - Don't add enhancements until needed
2. **Trust the process** - Plan ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Review works for any task
3. **Be honest with confidence** - It's a tool for clarity, not judgment
4. **Iterate quickly** - Low confidence? That's fine, just iterate
5. **Customize naturally** - Let the workflow adapt to you

## FAQ

**Q: What if I need a feature not listed?**
A: Just describe what you need in natural language. The AI will adapt the workflow.

**Q: Is this replacing all other variants?**
A: Eventually, yes. But they'll remain available during transition.

**Q: Can I modify the template?**
A: Absolutely! It's designed to be adapted to your needs.

**Q: How is this different from Zen?**
A: Unified takes Zen's simplicity but adds smart scaling through progressive enhancement.
