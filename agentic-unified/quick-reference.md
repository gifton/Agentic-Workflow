```
agentic workflow [for ...] [with ...] [using ...] [in ...] [optimized for ...] [by ...]
```

## ðŸš€ Presets (80% of use cases)
- `agentic workflow express` - Ship in <2 hours
- `agentic workflow standard` - Balanced approach (default)
- `agentic workflow professional` - Production-ready
- `agentic workflow enterprise` - Full compliance
- `agentic workflow research` - Heavy exploration

## ðŸŽ¯ Common Combinations

### Web Development
```bash
# Quick API
agentic workflow for web API express

# Production API  
agentic workflow for web API with monitoring and testing professional

# Microservice
agentic workflow for microservice using DDD with checkpoints
```

### Data & ML
```bash
# Data Pipeline
agentic workflow for data pipeline with monitoring optimized for reliability

# ML Model
agentic workflow for ML model with metrics using Python

# Analytics Dashboard
agentic workflow for dashboard with visual progress in 1 day
```

### Time-Boxed Projects
```bash
# Hackathon (4 hours)
agentic workflow for prototype in 4 hours optimized for speed

# Daily Sprint

## ðŸ’¡ Smart Inference Examples

These commands automatically adapt:

- `for hackathon` â†’ Implies speed > quality
- `for production` â†’ Implies quality > speed  
- `in 2 hours` â†’ Removes non-essential steps
- `by distributed team` â†’ Adds async coordination
- `using TDD` â†’ Restructures entire flow

## ðŸ”§ Interactive Mode

Not sure? Just say:
```
agentic workflow
```
The AI will guide you through setup.

## âœ¨ Power User Tips

1. **Chain modifiers**: `with A and B and C`
2. **Multiple fors**: `for web API and CLI`
3. **Create aliases**: Define your own presets
4. **Start simple**: Add modifiers as needed
5. **Trust defaults**: System infers smartly
