# 🚀 Agentic Workflow - Multi-Agent Development System

> Transform complex development tasks into orchestrated multi-agent workflows with built-in confidence tracking, checkpointing, and quality assurance.

## 🎯 What is Agentic Workflow?

Agentic Workflow is a powerful framework for breaking down complex software development tasks into coordinated multi-agent systems. Instead of tackling overwhelming projects alone, you get three specialized AI agents working together:

- **🗺️ Orchestrator (Atlas)** - Plans and coordinates the entire workflow
- **⚡ Specialist (Mercury)** - Implements with domain expertise and confidence tracking  
- **✅ Evaluator (Apollo)** - Ensures quality with multi-dimensional assessment

```
