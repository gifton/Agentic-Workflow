# Balanced Agentic Workflow System

A practical middle-ground implementation that provides multi-dimensional assessment without overwhelming complexity.

## Philosophy
"Nuanced but not complicated" - More insight than simple 0-100, less complexity than enterprise systems.

## Simplified Scoring System

### Three Confidence Tiers
- **HIGH (80-100)**: Ready to proceed ‚úÖ
- **MEDIUM (60-79)**: Needs attention ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **LOW (0-59)**: Requires intervention üõë

### Three Core Dimensions
1. **Correctness (50%)**: Does it work correctly?
2. **Quality (30%)**: Is it well-crafted?
3. **Readiness (20%)**: Is it production-ready?

### Quick Assessment Method
```markdown
Specialist Self-Check (30 seconds):
‚òê Requirements clear
‚òê Have expertise  
‚òê Solution tested
‚òê Edge cases handled
‚òê Proven approach

Score: Check count ‚Üí Confidence level
```

## Workflow Triggers

```yaml
HIGH confidence ‚Üí Approve and continue
MEDIUM confidence ‚Üí Address specific issues
LOW confidence ‚Üí Stop and reassess approach
```

## Benefits Over Other Versions

### vs. Zen (0-100 only)
- ‚úÖ More nuanced understanding
- ‚úÖ Identifies specific weaknesses
- ‚úÖ Better guidance for improvements

### vs. Advanced (4D complex)
- ‚úÖ 75% faster to assess
- ‚úÖ Easier to understand
- ‚úÖ Still actionable
- ‚úÖ Less configuration

## Example Evaluation

```markdown
Task: Implement Rate Limiter
Overall: MEDIUM (74/100)

‚úÖ Correctness: 82 - Core logic solid
‚ö†Ô∏è Quality: 71 - Code needs polish
‚ö†Ô∏è Readiness: 65 - Missing stress tests

Issues:
1. No concurrent stress testing
2. Token bucket algorithm undocumented
3. Configuration validation incomplete

Action: Fix these 3 issues for HIGH confidence
```

## Configuration (Simplified)

```yaml
# Complete configuration
scoring:
  dimensions: [correctness, quality, readiness]
  weights: [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]
  
confidence:
  high: 80
  medium: 60
  auto_help: true
  
workflow:
  max_iterations: 3
  target_confidence: HIGH
```

## When to Use This Version

Perfect for teams that:
- Want more than pass/fail scoring
- Need to identify specific improvement areas
- Don't want complex enterprise features
- Value quick assessment cycles
- Prefer clear, actionable feedback

## Quick Start

1. Use the simplified templates
2. Apply 5-point checklist
3. Calculate three dimensions
4. Follow workflow triggers
5. Iterate until HIGH confidence

The sweet spot between simplicity and insight! üéØ
