# Simplified Confidence System

## Overview
A practical three-tier confidence system with quick assessment and clear actions.

## Three-Tier Model

### HIGH Confidence (80-100)
- **Meaning**: Solution is solid, ready to proceed
- **Indicators**: 
  - Clear requirements understood ✓
  - Proven patterns applied ✓
  - Tests passing ✓
  - Edge cases considered ✓
- **Action**: Continue to next phase

### MEDIUM Confidence (60-79)  
- **Meaning**: Functional but needs attention
- **Indicators**:
  - Some assumptions made ⚠️
  - Basic tests only ⚠️
  - Minor uncertainties ⚠️
  - Documentation gaps ⚠️
- **Action**: Address specific issues

### LOW Confidence (0-59)
- **Meaning**: Significant concerns
- **Indicators**:
  - Major unknowns 🛑
  - Untested approach 🛑
  - Missing expertise 🛑
  - Requirements unclear 🛑
- **Action**: Stop and reassess

## Quick Self-Assessment

### 30-Second Checklist
```markdown
Rate your confidence:

☐ I understand what needs to be built
☐ I have the required expertise
☐ My solution is tested/validated  
☐ I've handled main edge cases
☐ The approach is proven/standard

Scoring:
- 5/5 checked = HIGH (90+)
- 4/5 checked = HIGH (80+)
- 3/5 checked = MEDIUM (70+)
- 2/5 checked = MEDIUM (60+)
- 0-1/5 checked = LOW (<60)
```

### Confidence Factors

**Boost Confidence (+)**
- Found official documentation
- Similar code exists in codebase
- Tests are comprehensive
- Performance validated
- Security reviewed

**Reduce Confidence (-)**
- Making assumptions
- Novel problem space
- No examples found
- Complex interactions
- Time pressure

## Three-Dimension Scoring

### 1. Correctness (50%)
*Does it work as intended?*

- **HIGH (80+)**: All requirements met, edge cases handled
- **MEDIUM (60-79)**: Core functionality works, some gaps
- **LOW (<60)**: Major functionality missing or broken

### 2. Quality (30%)
*Is it well-crafted?*

- **HIGH (80+)**: Clean, maintainable, documented
- **MEDIUM (60-79)**: Readable but could be improved
- **LOW (<60)**: Difficult to understand or modify

### 3. Readiness (20%)
*Is it production-ready?*

- **HIGH (80+)**: Tested, benchmarked, secure
- **MEDIUM (60-79)**: Basic validation done
- **LOW (<60)**: Not ready for production

## Calculation Example

```markdown
Task: Build Authentication System

1. Correctness Check:
   - ✅ Login/logout works
   - ✅ Token validation correct
   - ⚠️ Password reset incomplete
   - Score: 75/100

2. Quality Check:
   - ✅ Well-structured code
   - ⚠️ Documentation sparse
   - ⚠️ Some duplication
   - Score: 70/100

3. Readiness Check:
   - ✅ Unit tests pass
   - ❌ No load testing
   - ❌ Security audit pending
   - Score: 50/100

Overall Score: (75×0.5) + (70×0.3) + (50×0.2) = 68.5
Confidence Level: MEDIUM
Action: Complete password reset, add load tests, security review
```

## Workflow Integration

### Decision Tree
```
Confidence Assessment
        ↓
    [HIGH 80+] → Proceed to evaluation
        ↓
    [MEDIUM 60-79] → Fix specific issues
        ↓           ↓
    [LOW <60] → Major intervention needed
                  ↓
              Options:
              - Simplify approach
              - Get expert help  
              - Break into smaller tasks
              - Research unknowns
```

### Specialist Communication
```markdown
## Status Update

Current Confidence: MEDIUM (72/100)

Breakdown:
- Correctness: 80 ✅
- Quality: 70 ⚠️
- Readiness: 60 ⚠️

Issues Identified:
1. Missing integration tests
2. Performance not validated
3. Error messages need improvement

Plan: Address these 3 issues to reach HIGH confidence
```

## Benefits of Simplified System

1. **Quick Assessment**: 30 seconds vs 5+ minutes
2. **Clear Actions**: Direct mapping from score to next steps
3. **Easy to Calibrate**: Simple checklist prevents overconfidence
4. **Maintains Nuance**: Still captures multiple dimensions
5. **Human-Friendly**: No complex math or weighted averages

## Configuration

```yaml
confidence:
  tiers:
    high: 80
    medium: 60
  
  dimensions:
    - name: correctness
      weight: 0.5
    - name: quality
      weight: 0.3
    - name: readiness
      weight: 0.2
  
  actions:
    high: "proceed"
    medium: "address_issues"
    low: "reassess_approach"
```

This system provides the insight of multi-dimensional scoring without the complexity overhead!
