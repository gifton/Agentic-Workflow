```

### Confidence Validation Protocol
```markdown
## Confidence Calibration Check

1. **Claim Verification**
   - Does confidence match complexity?
   - Are uncertainties acknowledged?
   - Is evidence provided?

2. **Historical Calibration**
   - Compare with past predictions
   - Identify bias patterns
   - Adjust for overconfidence

3. **Red Flags**
   - High confidence + high complexity
   - Low confidence + simple task
   - Sudden confidence changes
   - Missing uncertainty documentation

4. **Calibration Scoring**
   - Perfect calibration: 100
   - Slight over/under: 80-90
   - Moderate bias: 60-80
   - Severe miscalibration: <60
```

### Phase 3: Confidence Validation
```markdown
## Specialist Confidence Audit

1. **Evidence Review**
   For each confidence claim:
   - Is evidence provided?
   - Does evidence support claim?
   - Are alternatives considered?

2. **Uncertainty Analysis**
   For each uncertainty:
   - Is impact assessed?
   - Are mitigations proposed?
   - Is research suggested?

3. **Calibration Check**
   ```
   actual_quality = measured_score
   claimed_confidence = specialist_confidence
   calibration_error = abs(actual_quality - claimed_confidence)
   
   if calibration_error > 15:
       flag_for_calibration_training
   ```

4. **Recommendation**
   - Well-calibrated: Proceed
   - Overconfident: Reduce by factor
   - Underconfident: Encourage boldness
```
