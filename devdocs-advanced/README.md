# Enhanced Agentic Loop System for Swift Low-Level Libraries

## Overview
This enhanced multi-agent workflow system builds upon the Agentic Loop framework with advanced features specifically designed for complex Swift libraries and frameworks requiring low-level systems programming, performance optimization, and architectural excellence.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Checkpoint System
- Automatic state persistence after each phase
- Crash recovery and workflow resumption
- Decision history tracking with rationale
- Rollback capabilities to previous checkpoints

### 2. Confidence Metrics
- Self-assessment scoring (0-100) by specialists
- Dynamic agent spawning based on confidence thresholds
- Uncertainty quantification for complex decisions
- Confidence-weighted output aggregation

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- Real-time workflow monitoring
- Asynchronous agent communication
- Plugin system for custom event handlers
- Performance profiling and metrics collection

## Core Principles
1. **Systems-First Design** – Deep understanding of memory, concurrency, and performance
2. **Mathematical Rigor** – Formal verification and complexity analysis
3. **Adaptive Intelligence** – Dynamic workflow adjustment based on task complexity
4. **Production Excellence** – Zero-tolerance for placeholder code or technical debt
5. **Continuous Learning** – Workflow improvements based on historical performance

  critical: 95      # Security, memory safety
  high: 90          # Core functionality
  standard: 85      # General features
  experimental: 70  # Prototype code
  
auto_spawn_threshold: 75  # Spawn additional specialist
uncertainty_flag: 60      # Request human review
```

### Event Subscriptions
```yaml
events:
  workflow.started: [logger, metrics_collector]
  specialist.confidence.low: [orchestrator, alert_system]
