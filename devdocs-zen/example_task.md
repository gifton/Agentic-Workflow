# Example Task: Build a Simple Calculator

This example demonstrates the minimal zen workflow approach.

## Task Description
"Build a command-line calculator that supports basic operations (+, -, *, /) with error handling."

## How to Use This Example

1. Copy the template.md to your project
2. Tell your AI assistant: "Use the zen agentic workflow to build a command-line calculator"
3. The AI will follow the minimal single-file workflow

## Expected Flow

The zen approach uses a single streamlined workflow:

1. **Understanding** - AI analyzes the requirements
2. **Planning** - Quick mental model of the solution
3. **Implementation** - Direct coding with confidence tracking
4. **Validation** - Test and verify the solution

## Sample Interaction

```
User: "Build a command-line calculator using the zen workflow"

AI: Following zen workflow...
- Confidence: 85% - Clear requirements, standard implementation
- Implementing calculator with basic operations
- Adding error handling for division by zero
- Creating simple CLI interface
- Testing with sample calculations
- Complete! Calculator ready to use.
```

## Key Benefits Demonstrated

- **Minimal overhead** - No multiple files or complex coordination
- **Visual progress** - Clear confidence indicators
- **Fast execution** - Direct path from requirement to solution
- **Zen-mcp compatible** - Works seamlessly with zen tools

## When This Approach Shines

- Quick prototypes
- Well-defined tasks
- Solo development
- When you value simplicity over process
